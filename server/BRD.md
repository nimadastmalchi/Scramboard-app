# Final Project: Chat Component Business Requirement Doc
## Requirements

### P0 requirements
- The chat functionality would let users send and read real-time chat messages that
  are organized into rooms called Channels. Users see a list of all the channels 
  on the server and can click one to enter that channel. Inside, they see all the 
  messages posted to that channel by any user, and can post their own messages.
  All messages belong to a channel and all channels are visible to all users; we
  don't need to implement private rooms or direct messages.

- Channel names are unique strings of numbers, letters, and underscores (and no
  spaces). Any user can create a new channel, and the user who created a channel
  can delete it and all messages.

- Like Slack, messages may be threaded as Replies in response to a message in a
  channel. Messages in the channel will display how many replies they have if
  that number is greater than zero. Like in Slack, clicking will open the reply
  thread alongside the current messages in the channel. We don't support nested
  threads; messages either belong directly to a channel or are replies in a
  thread to a message that does, but replies can't have nested replies of their
  own.

- Scramboard is a single-page web application. We serve a single HTML request on load
  and do not refresh the page, so is the chat component. As users navigate to a channel, 
  the application updates the navigation bar to reflect what channel they are in, and navigating
  to the URL for a specific channel opens the single-page application with that
  channel open.

- Other than loading the initial page, all interaction with the server is
  handled via JSON API requests. This includes authenticating users, retrieving
  channels and messages, and creating new channels and messages. These requests
  are served by a Express API.

- All data about users, channels, and messages is stored in Firebase database.

- Other features not listed here are not in scope, like @-mentioning
  users, avatars, rich text or the like.


### P1 requirements
- Like Slack, if a message contains any URLs that point to [valid image formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Supported_image_formats),
  display the images in the chat at the bottom of the message. Unlike Slack,
  we won't support uploading images from the user's computer.

- The channel display shows the number of unread messages in each channel (so
  somewhere you'll have to track the id of the most recent message a user has
  seen in each channel).

- The chat component should use responsive styling to render reasonably in a phone browser.
  In particular, when a user is not in a channel they should see the list of
  channels, and when they are in a channel or in a thread they should see just
  the messages in that channel or thread, with some menu element to let them
  return to the channel list.

- Users should have a display name and an email address, and be able to update
  either in the app. Users authenticate with their email address and a password,
  and can reset a lost password by having the service send them a magic link. We may
  use the [SendGrid API](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python) to send
  these messages, we can register free account for the third party email service.
  
- Chat component automatically sends non-blocking requests to the server to check for new
  channels and new messages in a channel. Like Slack, when it finds new messages
  in a channel, it displays a notification to users in that channel without
  moving the existing messages on the page. Users may click on the notification
  to load the new messages.
